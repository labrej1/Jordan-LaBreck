The fortune you seek is in another cookie
A closed mouth gathers no feet.
A foolish man listens to his heart. A wise man listens to cookies.
If you look back, you’ll soon be going that way
You will live long enough to open many fortune cookies
Do not mistake temptation for opportunity.
He who throws dirt is losing ground.
Some men dream of fortunes, others dream of cookies
We don’t know the future, but here’s a cookie.
The world may be your oyster, but it doesn't mean you'll get its pearl
You will be hungry again in one hour.
The road to riches is paved with homework.
Fortune not found? Abort, Retry, Ignore.
Help! I am being held prisoner in a fortune cookie factory
